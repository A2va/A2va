## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science, and in my spare time I work on projects that I hope will be useful to others. My projects are quite diverse, as I enjoy exploring and testing new ideas. That's where my pseudonym "A2va" comes from, inspired by the French phrase "Ã  tout va", which literally means "in all directions".

I'm also a regular contributor to [XMake]((https://xmake.io/#/)), a Lua-based build system focused primarily on C and C++.
